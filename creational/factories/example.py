"""
Factory Design Pattern

Motivation:
 - Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
 - Initializer is not descriptive
 - Wholesale object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to:
   . A separate method (Factory method)
   . That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
   . Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory
